All of my portofolio so far

## List of Project:
1. US Airlines Flight Analysis and Delay Prediction
This project aim to analyze the various factors that contribute to flight delays and build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed. The model was trained on a dataset of flights from various airlines and the results were evaluated based on the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
